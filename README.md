Key Features
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
Normalized/standardized features for consistent scaling.


Model Development
Implemented multiple ML models including:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost / Gradient Boosting
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV for optimal performance.

Model Evaluation
Used classification metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
ROC curves and confusion matrices to compare models.
Best model achieved ROC-AUC score of 0.72.
Business Impact

The model provides insights into borrower risk profiles.
Helps lenders minimize losses by identifying high-risk applications.
